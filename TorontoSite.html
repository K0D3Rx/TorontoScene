            <h2>Oh Toronto, sing me a song in the key of Eh!</h2>
            <p>It's diverse, it's chaotic, it's massive, it's cold. That's Toronto for you and man is she ever beautiful. Nestled within this beautiful city lies a music scene full of vibrance, excitement and decibels. Whether you're a hardcore kid looking to release some tension in the pit, or a mainstream top 40 fan who secretly loves to sing in the shower, or Both! Toronto has plenty to offer even the most hardcore of music aficionados.</p>

            <p>Let's be honest, One would be hard-pressed to encounter someone who has never heard of Drake. The Toronto native single handedly pointed the spotlight on Toronto and blazed a path for local artists to be discovered. It's this influence that led him to be named ambassador for The Toronto Raptors, receieve the key to the city and dub Toronto, "The 6ix". If the world wasn't paying attention before, it sure is now.

            <h2>The Underground</h2>
            <p>The music is loud, the venue is small and all you can tell yourself is, "I'm far away from home". Welcome to the underground. Gone are the fancy lights, the large tour buses, the expensive venues and the crowds of 10,000 plus. All that remains is a band, a stage, some beer and a gathering of people you wouldn't normally see on a daily basis. Although it's gritty and not meant for everyone, an amazing experience lies within Toronto's underground scene.</p>
